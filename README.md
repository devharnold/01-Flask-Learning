# 01-Flask-Learning
A learner repository on Flask
We are doing some learning on Python's Web Framework, Flask and discover and gain insights on how the particular web framework works

First of all we are going to start with creating a Virtual environment, then we run a command to install Flask
!But before we do it, we need to check our python's version. From my end I'm currently on Python3.

Good to go! We can now run a command to create a python virtual environment (venv)
Now from the Virtual environment, is where we will be running our commands and running our web app.

We are first going to do little work to just have a clue on this Web Framework
